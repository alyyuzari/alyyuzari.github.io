**I Opened a Book**
*By Julia Donaldson*


<p>I opened a book and in I strode.<br>
Now nobody can find me.<br>
I’ve left my chair, my house, my road,<br>
My town and my world behind me.</p>


<p>I’m wearing the cloak, I’ve slipped on the ring,<br>
I’ve swallowed the magic potion.<br>
I’ve fought with a dragon, dined with a king<br>
And dived in a bottomless ocean.</p>

I opened a book and made some friends.<br>
I shared their tears and laughter<br>
And followed their road with its bumps and bends<br>
To the happily ever after.<br>

I finished my book and out I came.<br>
The cloak can no longer hide me.<br>
My chair and my house are just the same,<br>
But I have a book inside me.
