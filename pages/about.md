There are many things I have been called in my life - cat lady, nerd, or whale after eating five meals a day but I most respond to the name Alyssa, or Aly when you are lazy.

I come from _Malaysia_ to study publishing in a wonderful institution in Oxford, and also to lie in on sundays when motivation has officially left me.
